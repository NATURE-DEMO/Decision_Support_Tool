The Adriatic Basin in Macedonia consists of the watershed of the Black Drim (Crn Drim) River. Through it, the western and southwestern parts of the Republic of North Macedonia are drained, covering an area of 3,350 kmÂ², or about 13% of the country's territory. In terms of size, it is the second-largest river basin in the Republic of North Macedonia. This basin also includes the drainage areas of Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa. The most significant river in this basin is the Black Drim.
The Black Drim flows out of Lake Ohrid in Struga through an outlet at an altitude of 695 meters. It initially flows northward through the Struga Plain to the village of Tashmarunishta, where it enters the dammed Drimkol Gorge, forming Lake Globocica. Below the Globocica dam, the river briefly re-emerges as a free-flowing stream before entering the neighboring Debar Lake. It exits Debar Lake at the Shpilje Dam and continues for 12 km as a border river. Then, in the Debar Plain, west of the village of Spas, at an elevation of 746 meters, it enters the Republic of Albania.
