Historical records and regional risk assessments consistently highlight two primary hazards of concern for the demonstration area: landslides and rockfall. The region is increasingly affected by climate variability, with prolonged droughts and episodes of intense rainfall or snowfall. These conditions accelerate soil erosion, slope washouts, and ground instability, raising the likelihood of the aforementioned hazards. 

Landslides:
A landslide is the downward movement of soil, rock, or debris due to gravity, often triggered by factors such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, or unstable ground conditions. In the context of the Globocica Dam, landslides pose a risk to the stability of the surrounding terrain, impacting both the dam infrastructure and the surrounding environment. Historically, landslides have been a known hazard in the region due to the steep topography and the presence of loose, unconsolidated materials. Previous landslide events in the area have caused damage to infrastructure, transportation routes, and ecosystems.
Landslides can be infrequent but highly disruptive when they occur. Their frequency is often influenced by seasonal factors such as heavy rainfall or snowmelt, as well as seismic activity. In some cases, landslides may occur with greater frequency after intense weather events or as a result of changes in land use or vegetation cover.
Landslides can lead to the deposition of debris and soil near the dam, which may block water flow or damage critical infrastructure. They can also contribute to erosion and further destabilization of the surrounding landscape, affecting the overall safety and functionality of the dam and its spillway system.

Rockfall:
Rockfall refers to the sudden and rapid descent of rocks or debris from a steep slope or cliff. It is a significant hazard around the Globocica Dam due to the geological conditions of the surrounding area, where unstable rock formations can cause rocks to fall or slide into the spillway chute or dam infrastructure. Historical events of rockfall in the area indicate recurring risks, particularly in regions with steep terrain and loose rocks.
The frequency of rockfall events can vary, but their impact is heightened during periods of heavy rainfall or seismic activity, which can destabilize rock formations. It may not happen frequently, but the consequences can be severe when it does. The spillway chute, being directly impacted by rockfall and landslide hazards, can experience blockage or damage, disrupting the flow of water from the dam, potentially compromising the dam's safety and performance.
