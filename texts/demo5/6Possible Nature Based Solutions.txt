For landslide and rockfall stability risk, the possible proposed NbS types are:
●	Afforestation and reforestation
●	Terracing (slope shaping, reduction of slope inclination)
●	3-D steel grids (vegetated)
●	Reinforced soil and earth packs (vegetated)
●	Protection forest management
●	Live staking and Live fencing (for slope engineering)
●	Live layered techniques.
