Existing Grey Protective Infrastructure:
The right-bank zone of the Globocica Dam, located near the spillway chute and the service access road, is characterized by occasional rockfall events. This hazard has likely been the main reason for the installation of protective wire mesh across part of the slope. 

Wire mesh for slope stabilisation:
The installation of a steel grid mesh on the slope above the spillway chute represents a conventional engineering measure aimed at stabilizing the surface layer of soil and rock by preventing loose material from detaching and descending onto critical infrastructure (Figure 3). The mesh functions as a short- to medium-term protective intervention, providing immediate stabilization to the most vulnerable slope sections.
