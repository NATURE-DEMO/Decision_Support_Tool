The watershed of the Black Drim covers an area of 3,350 km² and receives an average annual precipitation of 933 mm. This makes it the most water-rich basin in Macedonia relative to its surface area. The average annual discharge is 52 m³/s, which corresponds to a total water volume of 1,640 million m³ in a moderately wet year and 829 million m³ in a dry year.
The Black Drim basin (along with the watersheds of Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa) belongs to the Western Macedonian hydrological region. It holds the largest water resources in the Republic of Macedonia, with relatively small fluctuations in river flow throughout the year. The maximum flow occurs in May, while the minimum is recorded in August and September.
