The Globocica Dam demonstration focuses on a critical dam infrastructure system and its associated assets, including the dam structure, spillway chute, intake tunnel, service road, and service building. The demonstration site is exposed to a range of climate-related hazards that primarily affect water- and solid-mass-driven processes. These hazards have direct implications for the structural integrity, operational reliability, and maintenance requirements of the dam system.

The assessment addresses both current climate conditions and projected future developments, using regionally derived climate indicators that are spatially referenced and aligned with the methodological requirements of the climate risk assessment framework. The analysis considers how gradual climatic changes and sudden extreme events interact with dam-specific assets, leading to physical damage, operational interruptions, and increased capital and operational expenditures. Particular emphasis is placed on heavy precipitation, erosion, landslides, and rockfall, which represent the dominant hazard mechanisms affecting the Globocica Dam system.
