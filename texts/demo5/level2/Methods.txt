The climate risk assessment applies an indicator-based approach using regional climate datasets, including NCAR and IHCCantabria data, together with climate indicators and impact indices developed within the project framework. The indicators describe both baseline climatic conditions and projected changes under mid-term and long-term climate scenarios. Climate drivers and hazards are classified into acute and chronic processes, reflecting short-term extreme events and longer-term climatic trends.

Climate indicators are selected based on the geographic location of the demonstration site and the sector classification of the critical infrastructure, in this case dams. The indicators are spatially referenced and linked to specific infrastructure assets and potential consequences. Hazard severity is derived from the percentage variation of each indicator across climate scenarios, following predefined methodological thresholds.

Exposure is assessed using a standardized approach. In the absence of detailed economic valuation data, a default medium exposure level is applied to ensure consistency and comparability across the assessment. Vulnerability is evaluated through the combined analysis of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity reflects the degree of physical damage, operational disruption, and maintenance implications associated with each hazard-asset interaction, while adaptive capacity represents the current ability of the infrastructure system to withstand, respond to, and recover from climate-induced impacts.
