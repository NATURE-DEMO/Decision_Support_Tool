Afforestation and Reforestation: Planting native trees on the slopes surrounding the reservoir to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.

Gully Control Measures: Implementing bioengineering structures in gullies to trap sediment and reduce the velocity of water flow before it reaches the reservoir.

Slope Stabilization: Using vegetation and technical biological measures to secure unstable slopes along the reservoir banks and access roads, preventing landslides and rockfalls.

Sediment Traps: Creating small, nature-based barriers (e.g., wooden check dams) in upstream tributaries to capture sediment loads.
