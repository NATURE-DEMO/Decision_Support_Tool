Mean annual temperature is projected to increase from 6.7 °C under baseline conditions to approximately 9.1–10.9 °C in the long-term period. This corresponds to increases of up to +63.3% under high-emission scenarios and is accompanied by greater temperature variability. Cold extremes decline substantially, with days below −20 °C decreasing by more than 80%, indicating a strong reduction in frost-related hazards.

Total annual precipitation remains relatively stable, ranging between approximately 1070 mm and 1160 mm, but hydrological extremes intensify. The number of consecutive dry days increases from 26.5 to more than 36, corresponding to an increase of up to +38.5%, while drought probability rises from 0.07 to 0.09. These trends indicate increasing water stress and more pronounced dry periods that can affect dam operation and reservoir management.

Heavy precipitation hazards become more critical despite limited changes in annual totals. The maximum five-day precipitation increases from 109.6 mm/day to approximately 119 mm/day, while the 100-year return level of maximum five-day precipitation exceeds 212 mm in long-term projections. For solid-mass-related hazards, the 100-year return level of maximum one-day precipitation increases from 96.7 mm to more than 130 mm, with maximum one-day precipitation exceeding 68 mm/day. These changes, combined with decreasing accumulated solid precipitation and reduced humidity, increase the likelihood of slope instability, erosion, landslides, and rockfall around the reservoir.

The derived hazard indices show that water- and solid-mass-related hazards dominate the hazard profile of the Globocica Dam site. Water stress reaches medium to high hazard levels in the long term under high-emission scenarios. Heavy precipitation linked to maximum one-day precipitation reaches high hazard levels, while maximum five-day precipitation generally remains at low hazard levels. Mean annual temperature reaches high hazard levels in the mid-term and very high levels in the long term under high-emission scenarios, although this hazard does not directly affect the dam assets according to the impact models. Cold-wave-related hazards show no relevant variation and are not considered critical drivers of risk.

Exposure

Within the Level-2 framework, economic valuation of assets is optional. Due to the absence of detailed economic data for the demonstration site, a default Exposure Index of EI = 3 (medium) is applied. This standardized assumption enables the assessment to proceed conservatively while maintaining consistency across demonstration sites.

Vulnerability

Sensitivity analysis shows that the Globocica Dam system is particularly sensitive to precipitation-driven hazards. For capital expenditure impacts, assets display moderate to significant sensitivity (SI = 3–4) to heavy precipitation, erosion, landslides, and rockfall. The spillway chute shows high sensitivity (SI = 4) due to potential rockfall damage and operational stoppages. The dam itself also reaches SI = 4, reflecting the risk of spillway blockage during extreme rainfall events. The service road shows medium sensitivity (SI = 3) and the service building higher sensitivity (SI = 4) due to increased maintenance needs.

Operational expenditure sensitivity ranges from SI = 2 to 4. The intake tunnel shows low sensitivity (SI = 2) to operational stoppages caused by ice formation. The service road exhibits high sensitivity (SI = 4) to stoppages caused by heavy precipitation and lower sensitivity (SI = 2) to cold-wave-related maintenance delays. The service building shows moderate sensitivity (SI = 3) due to increased maintenance linked to precipitation-driven blockages.

Revenue sensitivity is moderate for the intake tunnel (SI = 3), reflecting operational interruptions caused by sedimentation and reduced reservoir capacity resulting from heavy precipitation, erosion, and landslides.

Adaptive capacity is evaluated based on asset lifetime, maintenance level, and design typology. The infrastructure is characterized by a high current lifetime, combined with medium to high maintenance levels and acceptable to resilient design characteristics. These factors balance each other, resulting in an adaptive capacity of AC = 0 or AC = 0.1, indicating a neutral contribution of adaptive capacity and no effective reduction in sensitivity.

The resulting vulnerability levels range from VI = 2 to 4 across assets and hazards. High vulnerability (VI = 4) is associated with capital expenditure impacts on the spillway chute and the dam, as well as increased operational costs for the service building and service road. Medium vulnerability (VI = 3) is linked to reservoir sedimentation affecting the intake tunnel and increased maintenance of operational assets. Cold-wave-related hazards produce lower vulnerability levels (VI ≈ 2), primarily associated with temporary operational delays.

Potential Risk

The Potential Risk Index integrates hazard, exposure, and vulnerability into a single normalized metric. The calculated values indicate very low to low risk levels (PRI = 1–2) across the Globocica Dam assets under mid-century high-emission conditions. The highest risk values (PRI = 2) are associated with precipitation-driven hazards, particularly heavy rainfall, erosion, and landslides, which affect both structural safety and operational continuity. Exposure and vulnerability are consistently medium to high, while hazard levels remain moderate, resulting in non-negligible but not extreme risk levels.

Lower risk levels (PRI = 1) are associated with cold-wave-related hazards and certain precipitation impacts on the service road and service building. Overall, no extreme risks are identified; however, the persistent presence of low to moderate risks highlights the importance of proactive adaptation measures, particularly targeting slope stabilization, spillway protection, and maintenance planning to enhance long-term resilience of the Globocica Dam system.
