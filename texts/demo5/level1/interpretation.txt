1. The Critical Vulnerability of the System (CIH)
The hazard exposure causes a near-collapse across the board, with the most severe deterioration in Health and Politics (HP), which drops from Good (2) to Very Poor (5). This indicates that the risk of landslides/rockfall to the dam and spillway is perceived as a critical threat to public safety and dam operation. The resulting media scrutiny and political pressure would render the dam management "Extremely unreliable" (Score 5). Safety (SRS) also drops to Poor (4), signifying significant reliability issues for the dam structure itself.

2. Standalone Solutions Are Inadequate or Harmful
Grey Only (CIHG): This solution is functionally flawed. While it addresses the physical damage (SRS is restored to Fair), it has a negative environmental impact (EV drops to Poor 4) and fails to address the political crisis (HP remains Poor 4). This suggests that the hard engineering work damages the watershed's ecology, which in turn fuels social/political opposition.

Nature-Based Solutions (CIHN): This strategy is environmentally friendly (EV is restored to Good 2) and addresses the social risk somewhat (HP is restored to Fair 3). However, it fails to restore the core Safety (SRS) or Economy (EC) to the necessary baseline levels, making it too risky for critical energy infrastructure.

3. The Combined Solution (CIHGN) Achieves Maximum Performance âœ…
The integration of Grey Infrastructure (for immediate, targeted stabilization) and Nature-Based Solutions (for long-term slope reinforcement and ecological restoration) is the only strategy that delivers comprehensive resilience:

Improved Safety: The SRS score improves from the baseline Fair (3) to Good (2), ensuring the dam and spillway are highly reliable with only rare failures.

Environmental Excellence: The EV score improves from the baseline Fair (3) to Very Good (1), demonstrating that NbS not only mitigates ecological damage but enhances the pristine watershed environment.

Full Restoration: All other KPIs, including the critical Health and Politics (HP), are successfully restored to Good (2), ensuring stability, trust, and reliable operation post-hazard.

Conclusion: For the high-stakes environment of the Black Drim hydropower plants, a holistic approach is mandatory. The Combined Solution (CIHGN) is the only way to achieve structural integrity, economic stability, and the necessary political confidence to manage this critical national asset.
