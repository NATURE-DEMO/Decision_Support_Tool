The Brunnsee catchment area is located in the area of the oceanic Alpine fringe climate. The climatic conditions are characterized by high precipitation (950 - 1450 mm) and low average annual temperatures (4 / 6째C). Cool summers (July average 12.5 to 15.1째C) and snowy, relatively mild winters (January average - 4.1 to 2.1째C) are striking. The long-term averages of the Wildalpen (610 m), Mariazell (875 m), Goll-rad (961 m) and B체rgeralpe (1267 m) stations were used to illustrate the climatic conditions, which are inconsistent due to the large relief (Hochschwab massif, surrounding mountains).
Characteristic for the Hochschwab-Nord region is the snow rose-spruce-fir-beech forest (Helleboro-Abieti-Fagetum: Zukrigl, 1973), which represents the north-eastern alpine formation of the limestone-spruce-fir-beech forest (Adenostylo-Abieti-Fagetum: Mayer, 1974). This forest community is dominant and widespread on almost all medium-sized sites on almost all slopes. It consists of the climax tree species spruce, fir and beech with a strongly varying mixture ratio. Larch is also represented in this forest community, sometimes in considerable proportions. High proportions of larch are partly due to earlier forms of utilization (large-scale clear-cutting), but on many sites the high proportion of larch in the spruce-fir-beech associations appears to be due to the natural forest development process. These larch-rich sites are mostly located on the shady side.
