1. The Severe Threat to Water Purity (CIH)
Without intervention, the hazard pushes nearly all KPIs to Poor (4), demonstrating a critical threat. The deterioration of Environment (EV) and Health and Politics (HP) from Very Good (1) to Poor (4) signifies that streambed erosion would seriously compromise water quality and long-term ecosystem stability, potentially requiring costly treatment and complex political management.

2. Standalone NbS is the Optimal Strategy (CIHN) âœ…
The Nature-Based Solution (CIHN) is overwhelmingly effective as a standalone measure. It fully restores all critical KPIs to a Good (2) or Very Good (1) condition, eliminating all hazard-induced Poor (4) ratings. This is a crucial finding for a strictly protected catchment like Brunntal, as it confirms that ecological restoration can provide sufficient technical stability while preserving the sensitive alpine environment.

3. Combined Measures Offer No Advantage
The Combined Solution (CIHGN) yields performance identical to the standalone NbS. This indicates that introducing hard-engineered (grey) infrastructure provides zero additional resilience benefit for Brunntal's specific streambed erosion problems. Therefore, the NbS-only approach is the most sustainable, ecological, and cost-effective strategy for safeguarding Vienna's drinking water for the long term.
