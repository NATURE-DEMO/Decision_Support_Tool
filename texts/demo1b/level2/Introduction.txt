The Lattenbach Valley demonstration site represents a typical alpine torrent system where water management infrastructure, transport networks, and protective structures are exposed to multiple interacting climate hazards. The area includes steep slopes, narrow channels, and critical assets such as bridges, roads, and torrent control infrastructures, all of which play a essential role in flood regulation, sediment transport, and service continuity.
The site is characterised by high annual precipitation, strong spatial variability in rainfall intensity, and a geological setting prone to slope instability. Historical events show that floods, landslides, and heavy precipitation repeatedly disrupt infrastructure and local communities. Climate change projections indicate that these hazards will intensify, while chronic processes such as rising temperatures, droughts, and water stress increasingly affect hydrological regimes and long-term system reliability.
Overall, the demonstration site illustrates a multi-hazard alpine basin where acute hydrometeorological extremes interact with long-term climatic trends, making it highly relevant for assessing climate risk and the performance of nature-based solutions.
