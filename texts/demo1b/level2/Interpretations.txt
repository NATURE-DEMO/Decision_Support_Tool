Hazard conditions and evolution
Average annual precipitation is approximately 804 mm, with extreme rainfall events often exceeding 50 mm in 24 hours, causing major floods and erosion. Flood events have produced water depths of 0.5–1.5 m in valley and settlement areas. Climate projections indicate a 15–25 % increase in the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events by 2050.
Mean annual temperature is 8.5 °C, but summer extremes exceed 30 °C, with 3–5 heatwave events per year. Heatwave probability increases by more than 164 % in the mid-term under moderate-emission scenarios. Drought probability increases by up to +350 %, and summer soil moisture may decline by up to 30 %. These changes significantly increase water stress and reduce ecological resilience.
The hazard index confirms that landslides and heavy precipitation are the dominant hazards, rated HIGH to VERY HIGH, while flooding remains MEDIUM to HIGH, especially along the torrent corridor and in the valley settlements. Temperature-related hazards show consistently LOW scores.
Exposure
The overall Exposure Index for the demonstration site is EI = 4 (High).
The roads and bridges show the highest exposure with EI = 4 due to high capital investment and economic importance. Torrent control infrastructures register EI = 3, while the electrical distribution network reaches EI = 2 (Medium). This indicates that failures would result in substantial economic and service losses.
Sensitivity and adaptive capacity
Sensitivity to landslides is high across the valley and settlements, with sensitivity scores of 4 for structural damage and revenue loss. In the slopes, landslide sensitivity reaches 5, reflecting irreversible erosion damage. Adaptive capacity is uneven: the valley locality achieves AC = 0 due to intermediate lifetime, while the slopes have AC = 0, indicating no effective buffering capacity.
Vulnerability
Vulnerability is high to extreme. Landslides and heavy precipitation produce VI = 4 for bridges and roads, while erosion in the slopes reaches VI = 5, representing extreme vulnerability. The lack of adaptive capacity significantly amplifies vulnerability in the most exposed locations.
Potential risk
Under the 2050 high-emission scenario, most representative assets reach a Potential Risk Index of 1 (Very Low Risk). This result reflects moderate hazard intensity combined with high exposure and vulnerability. While the numerical risk level is not extreme, it indicates persistent and recurrent damage potential, especially for slope stability, drainage performance, and sediment management.

DEMO 1.b – Austria (Brunntal)

General introduction
The Brunntal demonstration site represents a typical alpine torrent system where water management infrastructure, transport networks, and protective structures are exposed to multiple interacting climate hazards. The area includes steep slopes, narrow channels, and critical assets such as bridges, roads, and torrent control infrastructures, all of which play a essential role in flood regulation, sediment transport, and service continuity.
The site is characterised by high annual precipitation, strong spatial variability in rainfall intensity, and a geological setting prone to slope instability. Historical events show that floods, landslides, and heavy precipitation repeatedly disrupt infrastructure and local communities. Climate change projections indicate that these hazards will intensify, while chronic processes such as rising temperatures, droughts, and water stress increasingly affect hydrological regimes and long-term system reliability.
Overall, the demonstration site illustrates a multi-hazard alpine basin where acute hydrometeorological extremes interact with long-term climatic trends, making it highly relevant for assessing climate risk and the performance of nature-based solutions.
Methods
The assessment applies an indicator-based hazard characterization using regional climate datasets, including the EURO-CORDEX ensemble, national environmental records, and the project’s Climate Indicators and Impact Indices framework. Indicators such as temperature, precipitation, drought probability, water stress, and heavy rainfall intensity are spatially linked to infrastructure assets across the valley slopes, channels, and urban areas.
Climate hazards are classified as acute or chronic following the established typology. Acute hazards include floods, landslides, heavy precipitation, and debris flows, while chronic hazards include temperature increase, drought, water stress, and soil moisture decline.
The methodology automatically identifies relevant climate hazards based on geographic location and infrastructure sector. Exposure is quantified using economic valuation of assets, including capital and operational expenditures and revenues. Sensitivity captures damage severity, operational disruption, and maintenance requirements, while adaptive capacity reflects infrastructure age, maintenance level, and design robustness. These components are integrated to calculate vulnerability and, finally, a potential risk index for representative assets under future climate scenarios.
Quantitative results and interpretations
Hazard conditions and evolution
Average annual precipitation is approximately 1804 mm, with extreme rainfall events often exceeding 100 mm in 24 hours, causing major floods and erosion. Flood events have produced water depths of 0.5–1.5 m in valley and settlement areas. Climate projections indicate a 15–25 % increase in the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events by 2050.
Mean annual temperature is 3.75 °C, but summer extremes exceed 30 °C, with 3–5 heatwave events per year. Heatwave probability increases by more than 164 % in the mid-term under moderate-emission scenarios. Drought probability increases by up to +350 %, and summer soil moisture may decline by up to 30 %.
