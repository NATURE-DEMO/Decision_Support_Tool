Proposed NbS: The solution focuses on forest management and soil bioengineering.

Details: Specifically, this involves the maintenance and enhancement of protection forests combined with technical biological measures to stabilize steep slopes.

Goal: These measures are designed to prevent landslides and rockfalls that threaten the critical water supply infrastructure (springs) located in the area.
