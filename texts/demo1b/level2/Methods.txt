The assessment applies an indicator-based hazard characterization using regional climate datasets, including the EURO-CORDEX ensemble, national environmental records, and the project’s Climate Indicators and Impact Indices framework. Indicators such as temperature, precipitation, drought probability, water stress, and heavy rainfall intensity are spatially linked to infrastructure assets across the valley slopes, channels, and urban areas.
Climate hazards are classified as acute or chronic following the established typology. Acute hazards include floods, landslides, heavy precipitation, and debris flows, while chronic hazards include temperature increase, drought, water stress, and soil moisture decline.
The methodology automatically identifies relevant climate hazards based on geographic location and infrastructure sector. Exposure is quantified using economic valuation of assets, including capital and operational expenditures and revenues. Sensitivity captures damage severity, operational disruption, and maintenance requirements, while adaptive capacity reflects infrastructure age, maintenance level, and design robustness. These components are integrated to calculate vulnerability and, finally, a potential risk index for representative assets under future climate scenarios.
