Since 2007, the Institute of Mountain Risk Engineering (BOKU, Vienna) has developed a project to reduce sedimentation in Lake “Brunnsee” through the use of nature-based solutions, given its location within a nature reserve. 
The channel bed was raised and widened through the use of two nature-based solutions: I) diagonally overlapping tree spurs fixed to two piles driven into the river bed; and II) wooden log fences.
