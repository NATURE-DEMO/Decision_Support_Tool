The Brunnbach only has a discharge during either heavy rainfall events, prolonged precipitation or at the time of snowmelt, which causes the displacement of the bedload within the middle reach towards Lake “Brunnsee”. In order to prevent the sedimentation of the Brunnsee and to minimise the gravelling of the forest areas, the bedload has been periodically removed from the middle reach for 30 years. At the same time, dams were built on both sides of the Brunnbach with the removed material to limit overflowing.
However, the modification of the sediment regime increased the discharge and thus also the transport capacity of the channel, resulting in increased deposition of material out of the valley and into Lake Brunnsee. It was decided by the Municipal Department 32 Vienna Water to establish solutions to retain the bedload in the middle course in order to prevent the Brunnsee from silting up.
●	Hazard 1: Fluvial sediment transport
●	Hazard 2: Stream bank & bed erosion
●	Hazard 3: Debris floods
