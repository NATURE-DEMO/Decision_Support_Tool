This region experiences moderate temperatures year-round due to its proximity to the ocean. Summers are warm, but rarely excessively hot, and winters are mild with frequent rainfall. The ocean's influence moderates temperature swings, leading to a relatively narrow annual temperature range. Expect cloudy conditions and frequent precipitation, especially during the cooler months.
