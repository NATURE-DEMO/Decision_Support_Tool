The Gradaščica River basin is in central Slovenia, and the river and its tributaries run through Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec and through Municipality of the City of Ljubljana, where Gradaščica River drains into the karstic Ljubljanica River – the Gradaščica River basin is in the pre-alpine region. The Gradaščica river has torrential character river regime and drains a hilly terrain with highest peaks over 1000m a.s.l., with the average slopes (terrain) of 22° and the maximum slope of 65.1°. Gradaščica has several tributaries, which are all also of torrential regime. Where the Gradaščica River enters the City of Ljubljana, it splits to two channels at the Bokalce dam: to smaller “Mestna Gradaščica” (urbanised channel constructed by Jožef Plečnik – a famous Slovene architect), and larger “Mali Graben” channel. The Mestna Gradaščica was diverted as an artifi cial channel. The Gradaščica River springs in the hilly area of “Polhograjski dolomiti” and has a total main stream length of 26 km along the 154.3/158.8 km2 catchment area. Geologically, the catchment area is mainly composed of limestone, dolomite, sandy slate, and Groden layers (red sandstone, alevrolite, slate and conglomerate) with overlying Rendzic Leptosol, Distric and Eutric Cambisol, Chromic Cambisol, and Eutric Fluvisol soil.
