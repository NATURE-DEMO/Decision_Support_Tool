The Gradaščica River and Globčica Catchment demonstration site represents a complex river-system environment where water management infrastructure, urban drainage, and ecosystem services are exposed to multiple interacting climate hazards. The area includes river channels, embankments, drainage structures, catchment slopes, and urbanised floodplains, all of which play a critical role in flood regulation, sediment transport, and service continuity.

The site is characterised by high annual precipitation, strong spatial variability in rainfall intensity, and a geological setting prone to slope instability. Historical events show that floods, landslides, and heavy precipitation repeatedly disrupt river infrastructure and urban services. Climate change projections indicate that these hazards will intensify, while chronic processes such as rising temperatures, droughts, and water stress increasingly affect hydrological regimes and long-term system reliability.

Overall, the demonstration site illustrates a multi-hazard river basin where acute hydrometeorological extremes interact with long-term climatic trends, making it highly relevant for assessing climate risk and the performance of nature-based solutions.
