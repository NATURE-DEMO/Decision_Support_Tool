Hazard conditions and evolution
Average annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm, with extreme rainfall events exceeding 100 mm in 24 hours, and in some cases 150–200 mm, causing major floods and erosion. Flood events have produced water depths of 0.5–1.5 m in urban and agricultural areas. Climate projections indicate a 15–25 % increase in the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events by 2050.

Mean annual temperature is 10.2 °C, but summer extremes exceed 35 °C, with 5–7 heatwave events per year. Heatwave probability increases by more than 300 % in the mid-term under high-emission scenarios. Drought probability increases by up to +550 % in the long term, while summer soil moisture may decline by up to 25 %. These changes significantly increase water stress and reduce ecological resilience.

The hazard index confirms that droughts, heatwaves, and water stress reach HIGH to EXTREME levels in the future, while flooding and landslides remain MEDIUM to HIGH, especially along the river corridor and in the Globčica catchment. Wind-related hazards remain consistently LOW.

Exposure
The overall Exposure Index for the demonstration site is EI = 4 (High).
The urban drainage system shows the highest exposure with EI = 5 (Very High) due to high capital investment and economic importance. River infrastructure registers EI = 4, while the catchment-scale ecosystem and water management assets reach EI = 3 (Medium–High). This indicates that failures would result in substantial economic and service losses.

Sensitivity and adaptive capacity
Sensitivity to flooding and landslides is high across the river and urban areas, with sensitivity scores of 4 for structural damage and revenue loss. In the catchment slopes, landslide sensitivity reaches 5, reflecting irreversible erosion damage. Adaptive capacity is uneven: the river locality achieves AC = 0.1 due to good maintenance, while the Globčica catchment and urban area have AC = 0, indicating no effective buffering capacity.

Vulnerability
Vulnerability is high to extreme. Flooding and heavy precipitation produce VI = 4 for river and urban assets, while landslides in the catchment reach VI = 5, representing extreme vulnerability. The lack of adaptive capacity significantly amplifies vulnerability in the most exposed locations.

Potential risk
Under the 2050 high-emission scenario, most representative assets reach a Potential Risk Index of 2 (Low–Medium Risk). This result reflects moderate hazard intensity combined with high exposure and vulnerability. While the numerical risk level is not extreme, it indicates persistent and recurrent damage potential, especially for river stability, drainage performance, and sediment management.

DEMO 4 – Slovakia (Zvolen Municipality)
1. General introduction

The Zvolen demonstration site encompasses transport corridors, energy infrastructure, cultural heritage, and environmentally sensitive areas within a mountainous and river-influenced landscape. The site includes the Zvolen Bypass Corridor, the Pustý hrad slopes, and the Neresnica locality, each characterised by distinct hazard profiles and infrastructure functions.

The region experiences moderate annual precipitation but high rainfall variability, frequent freeze–thaw cycles, and increasingly hot and dry summers. These conditions create a complex risk environment where floods, landslides, wildfires, windstorms, and droughts affect infrastructure reliability and service continuity. Climate change projections indicate that chronic stresses such as heatwaves, water stress, and drought will increasingly dominate, while acute hazards remain locally severe.

2. Methods

The assessment uses indicator-based hazard characterization derived from regional climate datasets, national hydrometeorological records, and the project’s climate indicator framework. Indicators describe both baseline conditions and future projections under moderate and high-emission scenarios.

Climate hazards are identified automatically based on infrastructure location and sector, covering transport, energy, cultural heritage, and environmental assets. Exposure is quantified using economic valuation of assets, including capital and operational expenditures and revenues. Sensitivity captures damage severity, operational disruption, and maintenance requirements, while adaptive capacity reflects infrastructure age, maintenance level, and design robustness. These components are integrated to calculate vulnerability and potential risk.

3. Quantitative results and interpretations

Hazard conditions and evolution
Average annual precipitation is approximately 830 mm, but intense storms often exceed 50 mm/day, causing flash floods with water depths of 0.4–0.7 m. Climate projections indicate a 20–30 % increase in high-intensity rainfall events by 2050.

The region records over 40 frost days per year, contributing to slope instability. Mean annual temperature increases by +9.5 % to +16.5 %, while heatwave probability increases by more than 300 % in the mid-term. Drought probability increases by up to +550 %, and summer soil moisture may decline by up to 30 %. Wildfire season lengthens by 10–15 days, particularly affecting forested and heritage areas.

The hazard index identifies droughts, heatwaves, and water stress as the most critical hazards, rated HIGH to EXTREME, while flooding and landslides remain MEDIUM to HIGH in exposed corridors. Wind hazards remain LOW overall.

Exposure
The aggregated Exposure Index for Zvolen is EI = 4 (High).
The Neresnica locality reaches EI = 5 (Very High) due to the critical importance of the I/66 transport corridor. The bypass corridor scores EI = 4, and the Pustý hrad slopes score EI = 3, reflecting significant exposure of heritage and energy assets.

Sensitivity and adaptive capacity
Sensitivity is highest for landslides and flooding along transport corridors (SI = 4) and extreme for heritage assets exposed to wildfire (SI = 5). Adaptive capacity is limited: only the bypass corridor shows a modest buffer with AC = 0.1, while the other localities have AC = 0, indicating insufficient institutional and technical readiness.

Vulnerability
Vulnerability is high across all localities. Landslides and floods produce VI = 4 for transport assets, while wildfire impacts on cultural heritage reach VI = 5, reflecting irreversible damage potential. Limited adaptive capacity further amplifies vulnerability in the most exposed areas.

Potential risk
Under the 2050 high-emission scenario, most transport and heritage assets reach a Potential Risk Index of 2 (Low–Medium Risk). This reflects the combination of moderate hazard intensity with very high exposure and vulnerability. Although classified as low-medium, the risk is persistent and cumulative, indicating a strong need for targeted adaptation, especially slope stabilisation, drainage reinforcement, and wildfire prevention.
