The assessment applies an indicator-based hazard characterization using regional climate datasets, including the NCAR and IHCCantabria climatic database, national environmental records, and the project’s Climate Indicators and Impact Indices framework. Indicators such as temperature, precipitation, drought probability, water stress, and heavy rainfall intensity are spatially linked to infrastructure assets across the river system, catchment slopes, and urban areas.

Climate hazards are classified as acute or chronic following the RAMS-SHEEP typology. Acute hazards include floods, landslides, heavy precipitation, and debris flows, while chronic hazards include temperature increase, drought, water stress, and soil moisture decline.

The methodology automatically identifies relevant climate hazards based on geographic location and infrastructure sector. Exposure is calculated using economic valuation inputs for capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and revenues. Sensitivity reflects the degree of physical damage, operational disruption, and maintenance burden caused by hazards. Adaptive capacity accounts for asset age, maintenance level, and design characteristics. These components are combined to derive vulnerability and, finally, a potential risk index for representative assets under future climate scenarios.
