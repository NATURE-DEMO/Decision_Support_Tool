The climate hazard characterisation is based on internally stored, pre-processed, and quality-checked climate datasets integrated into the assessment tool. These datasets are automatically queried according to the geographic location of the analysed infrastructure, ensuring consistency and spatial relevance of climate indicators.

Key climate indicators such as temperature, precipitation, atmospheric humidity, drought indices, and solar radiation are spatially referenced and classified into acute and chronic hazards following the RAMS-SHEEP typology. Acute hazards include extreme heat and heatwaves, while chronic hazards include reduced humidity, low precipitation, and drought.

The methodology automatically identifies relevant climate hazards based on infrastructure type and location. Impact models link climate drivers to physical damage, operational disruptions, and increased maintenance requirements. Exposure is evaluated using spatial hazard layers and asset-specific characteristics such as location, hydrological position, vegetation structure, and maintenance dependence. Sensitivity reflects the degree of damage and operational impact caused by hazards, while adaptive capacity captures design typology, vegetation resilience, maintenance level, and life-cycle condition. These components are combined to derive vulnerability and potential risk indices for the assessed nature-based solutions.
