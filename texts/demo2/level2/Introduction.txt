The Brașov urban demonstration focuses on green infrastructure and nature-based solutions implemented within a dense urban environment. The demonstration site includes parks, vegetated corridors, infiltration zones, retention basins, and other green spaces that form a core component of the city’s climate adaptation strategy. These assets play a critical role in managing urban runoff, mitigating heat stress, supporting ecological connectivity, and providing ecosystem services to the local population.

The urban context of Brașov exposes green infrastructure to increasing climate pressures, particularly those related to rising temperatures, reduced atmospheric humidity, droughts, and irregular precipitation patterns. Unlike traditional grey infrastructure, the performance of these nature-based solutions is highly dependent on climatic conditions, vegetation health, and hydrological functioning. As a result, climate change poses both direct physical risks and indirect operational and maintenance challenges.

The Level-2 assessment therefore concentrates on understanding how heat- and water-related hazards affect the exposure, sensitivity, vulnerability, and overall climate risk of Brașov’s green infrastructure, with the aim of informing resilient NbS design and prioritisation.
