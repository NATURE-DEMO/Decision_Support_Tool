Hazard conditions and evolution

The hazard analysis shows that temperature- and water-related hazards dominate the future climate risk profile of the Brașov demonstration area. Extreme heat intensifies sharply and reaches Very High to Extreme hazard levels across all future scenarios. Heatwaves emerge as a new and increasingly severe acute hazard, rising from Medium severity in the mid-term to Extreme under long-term high-emission conditions.

Reduced atmospheric humidity and low precipitation consistently register High to Extreme hazard levels, indicating progressive drying of soils and vegetation stress. These conditions directly threaten the long-term effectiveness of green infrastructure by limiting evapotranspiration, soil moisture availability, and vegetation vitality. Drought, assessed using a standardized drought index, remains in the Medium–High range, suggesting more frequent short-term drought events rather than persistent multi-year droughts.

Solar radiation remains comparatively stable, with Low to Medium hazard levels, but its cumulative effect contributes to local heat stress and amplifies the impacts of extreme temperatures. Overall, the hazard assessment confirms that heat stress and water scarcity are the primary climatic pressures on Brașov’s green infrastructure.

Exposure

The overall Exposure Index for the Brașov demonstration site is EI = 4 (High). This reflects the strong dependence of green infrastructure performance on climatic conditions and its high socio-economic value within the urban system.

Exposure varies spatially and by NbS typology:

Retention basins and infiltration zones in compact, low-lying urban areas register EI = 4–5, due to combined exposure to heat accumulation, drought stress, and hydrological extremes.

Linear green corridors and vegetated strips show moderate exposure (EI = 3–4), benefiting from some hydrological connectivity but remaining vulnerable to prolonged dry periods.

Forest-edge zones and shaded parks exhibit lower exposure (EI = 2–3), supported by higher canopy cover, natural cooling, and better soil conditions.

These results indicate that urban density, surface sealing, micro-topography, and vegetation structure are the dominant drivers of exposure in Brașov.

Sensitivity and adaptive capacity

Green spaces in Brașov demonstrate very high sensitivity to climate hazards, particularly those related to low precipitation and drought:

Sensitivity related to capital expenditure reaches SI = 5, driven by the high costs of vegetation replacement, restoration services, and re-establishment of damaged green areas.

Operational expenditure shows significant to extreme sensitivity, with SI = 4–5, mainly due to increased irrigation demand, chemical treatments, and maintenance needs under reduced soil moisture and elevated temperatures.

Sensitivity to low precipitation is especially critical, reaching SI = 5, reflecting rising water-supply costs and increased maintenance intensity.

Sensitivity related to revenue losses ranges from low to significant, linked to reduced usability and ecosystem service provision during extreme heat and humidity stress.

Adaptive capacity depends on vegetation composition, maintenance quality, irrigation efficiency, and design typology. Newly established or well-maintained green areas with resilient designs show higher adaptive capacity, while older or poorly maintained assets exhibit reduced capacity. Adaptive capacity values are constrained within the methodological limits and act to partially offset, but not eliminate, high sensitivity.

Vulnerability

The Vulnerability Index confirms that Brașov’s green infrastructure is highly vulnerable to climate change, with an average vulnerability level of approximately VI ≈ 4.

Retention and infiltration basins show very high vulnerability (VI = 5) due to their exposure to both thermal stress and drought in low-lying urban areas.

Urban parks and green nodes exhibit high vulnerability (VI ≈ 4), driven by intensive maintenance requirements and strong sensitivity to heat and water scarcity.

Vegetated corridors show moderate-to-high vulnerability (VI ≈ 3.5), benefiting from partial hydrological connectivity but constrained by urban compaction.

Forest-edge and slope vegetation zones present lower vulnerability (VI ≈ 2.5) due to natural shading, deeper soils, and greater ecological stability.

These results highlight that vulnerability is highest where high exposure coincides with strong maintenance dependence and limited water availability.

Potential risk

The Potential Risk Index integrates hazard severity, exposure, and vulnerability into a single metric describing climate-related risk to Brașov’s nature-based solutions. The results confirm that heat stress, drought, and reduced humidity are the dominant drivers of risk for urban green infrastructure.

Assets with high exposure (EI = 4) and high vulnerability (VI ≈ 4–5) face persistent climate-related risks that threaten long-term functionality and ecosystem service delivery. While some hazards individually rank lower, their combined and cumulative effects significantly amplify overall risk.

The assessment demonstrates that effective climate adaptation in Brașov depends on resilient NbS design, prioritising drought-tolerant species, layered vegetation structures, improved infiltration and retention, and strong integration with urban hydrology to maintain performance under increasing heat and water scarcity.
