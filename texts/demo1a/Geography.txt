The catchment area of the Lattenbach is located in the west of Tyrol at the entrance to the Stanzertal and belongs for the most part to the cadastral municipality of Grins, and to a lesser extent to Strengen and Pians (Landeck district). Geographically, the study area is located in the Lechtal Alps (Northern Limestone Alps) on the southern slope of the Parseier Group and covers an area of around 5.3 km³. The Dawinspitze (2968 m) is the highest elevation, the mouth into the receiving water (Sanna) is at an altitude of 830 m above sea level. The project area investigated in the course of the work is limited to a section in the upper catchment area, i.e. from the municipal road bridge (980 m) upwards, and covers an area of approx. 3.4 km². The channel of the Lattenbach runs in a west-east direction in the upper reaches before continuing southeast after merging with the Radunbach.
Morphologically, the high alpine landscape of the Parseier Group is very rugged, with numerous very steep rock faces at higher altitudes. At lower altitudes, the landscape is characterised by sedimentary deposits, which are often overgrown by belts of mountain pines. Below this is a terraced landscape where the Grins settlement with its intensive agricultural use is located. Settlements were established early on these gentle, south-facing and fertile terrains.
