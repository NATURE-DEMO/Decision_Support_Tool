The Lattenbach area predominantly exhibits the climate type of an inner-Alpine dry climate (Pitschmann et al., 1970). However, the influence of the Atlantic-influenced northern Alpine climate is clearly recognisable (Meisel et al., 1984). The climate in the study area can therefore be described as a transitional climate between the continental, dry inner Alps and the precipitation-rich northern marginal Alps (Schwarz et al., 2004). The rich summer and moderate winter precipitation are characteristic of this climate. The average annual precipitation in the valley floor area is around 800-900 mm (in the driest parts) in the high Alpine zone at 1,850 mm, the temperatures are mostly moderate (BMLFUW, 2020).
There is an increased tendency for thunderstorms to form in a wide variety of weather conditions due to the geographical location. The combination of steep slopes exposed to the south and strong reflection from the light-coloured limestone and dolomite rocks leads to the subsoil drying out and high temperatures at small locations protected from the wind. This leads to sudden temperature fluctuations, especially in fall and early spring, and thus to difficult growth conditions for the vegetation (WALLNER et al., 2019). 
The average annual precipitation in the project area is 1300 mm per year (measurement period 1980-2010). The heavy precipitation amounts to 40 mm (duration level 15 minutes), 65 mm (duration level 60 minutes) and 80 mm (duration level 180 minutes). However, it should be noted that estimating precipitation in the project area is particularly difficult due to various uncertainties (especially the topographical situation) and that the calculated precipitation values are only a rough guide.
