Proposed NbS: The solution involves the widening of the torrent channel (bed widening) combined with soil bioengineering measures.

Details: This includes the use of vegetated crib walls and other bioengineering techniques to stabilize the slopes and channel banks.

Goal: The primary aim is to stabilize the channel, reduce the energy of debris flows, and mitigate flood risks effectively.
