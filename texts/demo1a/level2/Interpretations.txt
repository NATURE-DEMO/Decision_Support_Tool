Using the available economic data and the predefined limits, the Exposure Index has been calculated as 4 (High) for the Lattenbach site. These scores reflect the aggregated value of the infrastructure potentially exposed to climate hazards, indicating a significant level of economic relevance and exposure. Such findings have direct implications for risk prioritisation and adaptation planning.
Although the annual revenues for the Lattenbach system are relatively modest (1.80€ million/year), the total CAPEX reaches 18.00€ million/year, clearly exceeding the upper threshold for high exposure levels. When cross-referenced with the revenue bracket, this results in an Exposure Index of 4 (High) for the entire infrastructure system.
Despite the moderate operational return for Lattenbach, these outcomes highlight the economic significance of the asset base, particularly in terms of investment value and maintenance needs, placing the infrastructure in a high exposure category. This has important implications for risk and prioritisation of adaptation measures, as it indicates a high potential for economic disruption in the event of climate-induced damage, especially to critical components such as bridges and torrent control infrastructures, which represent the largest shares of CAPEX.
In both cases, moreover, the asset-level granularity provided by this breakdown allows infrastructure managers and decision-makers to identify specific elements that may require targeted adaptation strategies or cost-benefit analyses for protective measures. In this way, the Exposure Index not only contributes to the global risk score but also supports strategic investment planning and resource allocation within the broader climate resilience framework.
The Vulnerability Index (VI), as extensively described in Deliverable D.2.1, is calculated based on the combined evaluation of the Sensitivity Index (SI) of each exposed Critical Infrastructure (CI) asset and its corresponding Coping/Adaptive Capacity (AC).
The Sensitivity Index assigned to the asset “Bridge” is presented. The asset demonstrates a high sensitivity (score 4) to all impacts caused by landslides. These events can lead to structural degradation, necessitating reactive investments in repair or reconstruction. While the infrastructure may possess some inherent resistance to these hazards, its exposure in a mountainous region and the aging of its components elevate its sensitivity under projected climate scenarios.
With regard to Adaptive Capacity (AC), which represents the ability of the Critical Infrastructure (CI) to cope with and recover from climate-related impacts, the final AC for the current case study has been calculated according to the defined methodology. The resulting overall Adaptive Capacity score is 0.
The Vulnerability Index (VI) was consequently computed. This presents the VI values for each of the considered impacts.
