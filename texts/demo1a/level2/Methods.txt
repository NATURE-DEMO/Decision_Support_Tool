Alongside the identification of climate risks, it is necessary to identify the impact models for the region. This presents the respective impact models that are part of the internal logic of the screening tool. However, this analysis will focus on the “Bridges” asset in the transport sector.
This presents the values of the climate indicators considered for the current analysis, which have been defined based on the identified impacts that potentially affect the infrastructure.
Based on the compiled climate indicators, the Hazard Indices (HI) are now calculated for each of the climate hazards identified as relevant to the risk assessment. The Hazard Indices (HIs), calculated as the percentage variation of the relevant climate indicators at a given location, relative to a defined baseline period, are presented.
Based on these percentage variations of the climate indicators, the corresponding Hazard Indices (HIs) have been derived and are presented.
Based on the economic valuation of the assets potentially exposed, the next step involves calculating the corresponding Exposure Index (EI). This calculation is performed according to predefined thresholds and classification criteria established in the methodology.
