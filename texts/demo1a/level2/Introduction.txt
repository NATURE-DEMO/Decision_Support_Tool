Although the Risk Assessment Evaluation was carried out in accordance with the robust methodology described in Task 1.4 respectively WP2, the BOKU team agreed to consider the calculated values as “indicative values”.
This approach is intended to avoid potential conflicts and future arguments with stakeholders if the project's calculated results differ from their assessments and expectations, especially in relation to ministries or other project proposals. The rationale for this decision is supported by the following considerations:
Within the scope of the NATURE-DEMO project, precise economic values from the Lattenbach region and industry are currently not available.
Within the context of the Nature-Demo project, demonstrating a methodology is core. We therefore refrain from detailed designs and constructional planning, as this is subject to an established process by the local and federal authority panel and commissioned appraisers and planners. NATURE-DEMO will not anticipate local authority decisions on future interventions, but provide suggestions based on a theoretical framework and methodology. Therefore, the agreed approach is to be understood as a theoretical approach to illustrate the process using “indicative values” that are plausible and are “in the range of” realistic possibilities, without presenting them as current or exact values. This avoids the problem of having to justify discrepancies at a later stage.
