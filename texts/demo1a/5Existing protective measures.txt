The main grey (engineered) protective infrastructures documented for the Lattenbach Valley (Pians/Grins, Landeck) are:

●	Check dams / “Geschiebesperren” along the torrent (≈20 built since 1908; several damaged and periodically rebuilt/maintained). WIT Press
●	Channel training through Pians — raised masonry/concrete walls and enlarged channel capacity to pass debris-flow peaks without overtopping. WIT PressTiroler Tageszeitung Online.
●	Confluence works at the Sanna — groynes on the Sanna’s right bank and extension/raising of the Lattenbach embankment to reduce backwater at the mouth. WIT Press
●	Bridge adaptations at critical crossings (e.g., Reichsstraßenbrücke in Pians, Gerberbrücke in Grins/Pians) to reduce clogging/impoundment risks; measures include structural modifications such as foldable/replaceable railings, closure elements, and raising nearby bank walls. BOKU MeinBezirk.at
●	Periodic bed clearance and channel improvement works through the village (excavation of deposited material, repairing/sanitation of bank walls). Tiroler Tageszeitung Online
