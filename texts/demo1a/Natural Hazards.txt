The Lattenbach has been a subject of extensive research for several years due to the frequent occurrence of debris flows and debris floods. This is caused by the interplay of heavy rainfall events and the high availability of erodible sediments (e.g., fluvial sediment transport & stream bank erosion) produced by several different landslide types (e.g., rock rotational slide, rock compound slide, and earth flows).
Thus, a high hazard potential is given for the two towns and their associated infrastructures (e.g. roads, electrical grid) caused by debris flows or due to backwater of the Sanna river after sediment deposition. 

●	Hazard 1: Debris flows and debris floods
●	Hazard 2: Landslides
