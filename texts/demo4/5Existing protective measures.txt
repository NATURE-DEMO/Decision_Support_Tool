Zvolen’s protective infrastructure combines flood defences, slope stabilisation measures, and urban drainage systems, forming the backbone of its engineered risk reduction strategy. Much of this infrastructure was built between the 1970s and early 2000s, with selective upgrades over the past decade, and is maintained through a combination of national and municipal agencies.
Flood protection along the Hron and Slatina rivers is primarily provided by approximately 6.8 kilometres of earthen levees on the Hron and 2.3 kilometres on the Slatina within the municipal boundaries. These embankments typically have crest heights of 2.5 to 4.0 metres above adjacent terrain, crest widths of 3 to 5 metres, and side slopes of 1:2 to 1:3. They are designed to withstand flows with a return period of 50 years, corresponding to an estimated discharge of 1,200 m³/s for the Hron at Zvolen. However, their limitations became evident during the 2010 flood event (approximately a 70-year return period), when overtopping occurred in one section. While about 80% of these structures are in fair to good condition, the remaining 20% show erosion, settlement, and damage from vegetation and rodent activity, requiring reinforcement.
Retaining Walls and Slope Stabilisation
In Zvolen and its surrounding municipalities, retaining walls and slope stabilisation systems are critical components of the protective infrastructure, particularly in areas where steep hillsides and transport corridors intersect. Approximately 2.1 kilometres of retaining walls are currently in place, strategically located along vulnerable road and railway sections, as well as in urbanised slopes where residential or commercial development is situated on or below inclines. These structures vary in form and material: reinforced concrete walls, ranging from 2 to 6 metres in height, provide high-load stability in locations where soil pressure and potential landslide forces are significant, while gabion basket walls, generally 1.5 to 4 metres high, are more common along secondary roads and forest access routes, offering flexibility and drainage capacity in addition to slope retention.
Beyond vertical structures, slope reinforcement is achieved through anchored steel mesh systems covering roughly 14 hectares of terrain with gradients exceeding 35 degrees. These installations are particularly important in rockfall-prone areas, capturing dislodged material before it can reach transport infrastructure or inhabited zones. In addition, selective regrading and surface drainage channels have been implemented on certain slopes to manage runoff and reduce the likelihood of erosion or shallow landslides.
Condition assessments indicate that most reinforced concrete walls are structurally sound, although minor surface cracking and joint degradation have been noted in several locations, requiring preventive maintenance. Some gabion walls, however, show signs of corrosion of the wire mesh and localised settlement of stone fill, particularly those more than 20 years old. Annual rockfall removal operations are carried out along key sections of the railway line and upland roads, underscoring the ongoing interaction between natural slope processes and infrastructure safety.
Overall, while the current system of retaining walls and slope stabilisation measures has successfully prevented major slope failures in recent years, past incidents, such as the 2017 minor landslide along the E77 corridor, demonstrate that the combination of steep terrain, intense precipitation events, and freeze-thaw cycles continues to challenge these defences. The integration of nature-based measures, such as deep-rooting vegetation for slope binding and bioengineering techniques for erosion control, could provide a valuable complement to the existing grey infrastructure, extending its service life and improving long-term resilience. Among existing grey protection measures belong slope regrading and surface drainage.
Drainage Systems
The stormwater drainage network in Zvolen is an essential component of the city’s grey protective infrastructure, designed to manage surface runoff from both urban and peri-urban areas. The system comprises approximately 68 kilometres of underground pipelines, with diameters ranging from 300 millimetres in residential streets to 1,200 millimetres in primary collectors serving the central business district and industrial zones. These subsurface elements are complemented by roughly 12 kilometres of open, concrete-lined channels, primarily located in industrial estates, peri-urban catchments, and along certain transport corridors where rapid conveyance of runoff is necessary.
The original design capacity of the urban drainage system accommodates rainfall intensities between 50 and 70 millimetres per hour, equivalent to storm events with return periods of approximately 5 to 10 years. This standard, while sufficient for routine precipitation, has proven inadequate during high-intensity convective storms. Notably, during the 2014 and 2020 extreme rainfall events, when intensities exceeded 90 millimetres per hour, the system was overwhelmed, resulting in 0.4 to 0.7 metres of surface flooding in parts of central Zvolen and temporary road closures in low-lying neighbourhoods.
The operational condition of the drainage network varies by age and construction period. About 75% of the system is considered fully functional without significant restrictions. However, older segments, particularly those installed before 1985, show reduced hydraulic efficiency due to sediment deposition, calcification, and, in some cases, partial collapse of pipe sections. Regular inspections, conducted quarterly by the City of Zvolen Technical Services, include debris removal from inlets, clearing of blocked channels, and flushing of critical pipe sections to restore flow capacity.
In newer residential developments, stormwater management incorporates underground storage tanks and controlled outflow devices, which help to delay peak discharge and reduce pressure on downstream systems during intense rainfall. These modern elements, however, are not yet widespread across the city. In upland catchments feeding into the urban network, roadside ditches and culverts, as well as small check dams, help intercept and slow runoff before it enters the municipal system.
Despite regular maintenance, the increasing frequency of high-intensity rainfall events linked to climate change is placing the drainage network under greater stress. In combination with land use changes, such as increased impermeable surface cover, the system’s limited capacity during extreme events underscores the need for supplementary nature-based solutions, such as bioswales, infiltration basins, and green roofs, that can attenuate runoff volumes before they reach the grey infrastructure.
Riverbank Reinforcement
Riverbank reinforcement in Zvolen plays a critical role in protecting both urban and peri-urban areas from erosion, particularly along the Hron and Slatina rivers. The current system consists of approximately 3.4 kilometres of granite riprap armouring and 1.1 kilometres of reinforced concrete revetments, strategically placed to safeguard high-value infrastructure, including bridges, pumping stations, and densely built waterfront areas.
The riprap sections utilise locally sourced granite boulders with diameters ranging from 300 to 800 millimetres, placed on a graded filter layer to ensure stability and prevent loss of fine material during high-flow conditions. These armoured stretches are designed to dissipate hydraulic energy, reducing the erosive forces acting on the banks, and have generally performed well over the past decade. Regular inspections indicate that the riprap remains in good condition, with only isolated instances of settlement or displacement following major flood events.
The reinforced concrete revetments, found mainly in areas where space constraints or urban development limit the use of broader armouring, are vertical or near-vertical structures anchored into the riverbank. These revetments, some of which date back to the late 1980s, show evidence of ageing: approximately 300 metres display surface cracking, spalling, and joint deterioration, which, if left unaddressed, could compromise their integrity during prolonged high-water conditions.
Both types of reinforcement are concentrated near hydraulic pinch points, such as bridge abutments and sections where the river’s alignment naturally accelerates flow. While effective in preventing bank collapse, these hard-engineered solutions have ecological drawbacks, such as reduced riparian habitat and increased downstream flow velocities, which can exacerbate erosion in unprotected reaches.
Maintenance responsibilities are shared between the Slovak Water Management Enterprise (SVP) and municipal authorities. Annual inspections focus on identifying structural damage, vegetation encroachment, and debris accumulation, with repair works typically carried out in late summer or early autumn to avoid interference with peak flows. While the existing reinforcements provide a reliable first line of defence, their design capacity and ecological impact suggest a need for complementary nature-based measures—such as vegetated buffer strips or bioengineered banks—that can both stabilise river margins and restore some natural functions to the riparian corridor.
Other Protective Works
In addition to the primary flood defences, slope stabilisation systems, and riverbank reinforcements, Zvolen relies on several other engineered protective works that contribute to reducing hazard impacts across the municipality. These include transport infrastructure elements, debris control structures, and upland runoff management systems.
The city has seven major river crossings, five over the Hron and two over the Slatina, which, while primarily serving transport functions, also influence flood dynamics. These bridges are designed with hydraulic clearances between 2.5 and 4.0 metres above typical low-flow levels, enabling them to pass moderate flood discharges without overtopping. However, during extreme events, certain structures, such as the Slatina Bridge on Road I/66, act as constriction points, accelerating flow and contributing to upstream water level rise. The Slovak Road Administration and ŽSR (Slovak Railways) perform regular inspections to ensure structural stability and scour protection at bridge piers, with reinforcement works carried out when necessary.
Debris control in upstream catchments is achieved through a network of 14 small check dams, each between 0.5 and 2.0 metres in height. These are located on tributary streams flowing from the surrounding hills into the Slatina River, where they trap coarse sediment, boulders, and woody material mobilised during storms. While generally effective in reducing debris loads entering urban channels, several structures show sediment accumulation close to capacity and require dredging to restore their retention function.
Runoff management along forest and mountain access roads is provided by approximately 22 kilometres of roadside drainage ditches and culverts, designed to intercept overland flow and prevent washouts. These systems are maintained by forestry operators and municipal services, with routine clearance of blockages following storms. In addition, certain upland slopes incorporate diversion channels to redirect excess runoff away from vulnerable settlements and transport corridors.
Although these protective works serve important supporting roles, they are often secondary in design intent and can be overwhelmed during extreme events. For example, bridge constrictions during the 2010 flood and debris overtopping of check dams in 2020 highlight the limits of their performance under severe conditions. Integrating these grey measures with complementary nature-based solutions, such as vegetated flood ways, upstream retention wetlands, and reforestation of headwaters, would enhance their function, reduce maintenance demands, and provide additional resilience benefits.
