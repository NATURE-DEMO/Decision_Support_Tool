Zvolen is exposed to a range of climate-related hazards shaped by its geographic location at the confluence of the Hron and Slatina rivers, its varied topography spanning low-lying floodplains to steep upland slopes, and its continental climate with marked seasonal contrasts. Historical records, hazard maps produced by national agencies, and regional risk assessments consistently identify four primary hazard categories of concern: floods, landslides, windstorms, and wildfires, with additional seasonal hazards including freeze–thaw cycles and heatwaves.

Floods
Fluvial flooding is among the most significant risks to Zvolen’s population and infrastructure. The Hron and Slatina rivers, both with catchments prone to rapid runoff, have produced repeated high-water events, most notably in 1925, 1974, 1999, and 2010. The September 2010 flood, driven by intense rainfall over the upper catchments, overtopped levees in one section and inundated residential and commercial districts. Hazard mapping from the Slovak Water Management Enterprise (SVP) identifies extensive 100-year and 500-year flood zones encompassing key transport links, industrial areas, and parts of the urban core. Urban drainage is also susceptible to pluvial flooding during high-intensity summer storms, as seen in 2014 and 2020, when short-duration downpours caused street flooding up to 0.7 metres deep.

Landslides
The surrounding uplands, particularly in the Kremnica Mountains and the southern slopes of the Poľana range, are characterised by steep gradients and geologies prone to instability. Weathered volcanic and sedimentary formations, combined with intense rainfall or rapid snowmelt, trigger shallow landslides, debris flows, and rockfalls. Slope failures have affected both rural access roads and major transport corridors, including the E77 route. The most recent recorded incident in 2017 involved a minor landslide requiring immediate gabion wall reinforcement. Hazard maps from the Slovak Geological Institute highlight several medium- to high-risk slope zones within 5–10 kilometres of the city.
In Zvolen, slope stabilisation measures have been implemented along several high-risk sections of the E77 highway and railway corridors, using conventional engineering methods such as retaining walls, anchored steel mesh, and slope regrading. While these interventions have successfully reduced the occurrence of landslides in treated locations, hazard mapping and field inspections indicate that several slopes remain unstable and unprotected, particularly on secondary roads and peri-urban hillsides. These untreated slopes are typically characterised by steep gradients, weathered volcanic or sedimentary formations, and inadequate surface drainage, conditions that increase susceptibility to failure during intense rainfall or rapid snowmelt events.

Windstorms
Zvolen’s location in an open river valley intersected by transport corridors and flanked by upland ridges makes it vulnerable to windstorm events, particularly during the late autumn, winter, and early spring months when pressure gradients over central Europe intensify. Historical meteorological records from the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute indicate that wind gusts in excess of 90–100 km/h have occurred on multiple occasions over the past three decades. These events are often associated with fast-moving frontal systems or localised foehn-like downslope winds from the Poľana and Kremnica highlands.
The impacts of windstorms on Zvolen have included damage to roofs, windows, and lightweight structures, as well as uprooting of mature trees in urban parks and along transport corridors. Critical infrastructure has been affected, with past events causing downed power lines, temporary disruption of rail traffic, and blockages on the E77 highway from fallen trees. While forestry management in surrounding uplands reduces some risk by maintaining buffer zones along access roads, much of the urban tree cover, particularly older, top-heavy species, remains 
susceptible to windthrow.

Wildfires
Although Zvolen is not in Slovakia’s historically most wildfire-prone areas, the combination of hotter, drier summers and land-use changes has increased hazard potential in the surrounding uplands. The Poľana and Kremnica mountain ranges, with their extensive mixed forest stands, are vulnerable during prolonged summer droughts when vegetation moisture drops and fuel loads accumulate. Historical records show that wildfires here have generally been small to medium in size, yet fire danger indices during July and August have been trending upwards, indicating growing seasonal risk.

Freeze–Thaw Cycles
Zvolen’s continental climate produces pronounced seasonal temperature fluctuations, with winter lows frequently falling below –10 °C and rapid warming events during transitional seasons. These conditions lead to repeated freeze–thaw cycles, i.e. the expansion of water in soil, rock fractures, and construction materials as it freezes, followed by contraction upon thawing. Such cycles are especially frequent in late winter and early spring, and they are more severe on north-facing slopes, shaded road cuts, and elevations above 800 metres.

Heatwaves
While Zvolen’s central Slovak location historically experienced only occasional high-temperature episodes, climate records from the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute show a clear upward trend in both the frequency and duration of heatwaves over the past two decades. Maximum daily temperatures exceeding 35 °C, once relatively rare, are now recorded several times each summer, with prolonged hot periods becoming more common. These extreme temperature events are most intense in the city’s built-up areas and open valley floors, where the urban heat island effect amplifies ambient heat levels.
