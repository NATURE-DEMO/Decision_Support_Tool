The Zvolen demonstration focuses on a municipality-scale system with critical infrastructure spanning transport, energy, water management, cultural heritage, and environmental assets. The assessment covers three distinct localities: the Zvolen Bypass Corridor (E77), the Pustý hrad slopes, and the Neresnica locality. These areas are embedded in a complex natural setting shaped by mountainous terrain, volcanic and sedimentary geology, river floodplains, and forested slopes, which collectively influence exposure to climate-related hazards.

The region is affected by a broad range of acute and chronic climate hazards, including flash floods, landslides, wildfires, windstorms, heatwaves, droughts, and water stress. These hazards interact with infrastructure systems through physical damage, operational disruptions, and long-term degradation processes. The demonstration highlights how increasing climate variability amplifies both sudden extreme events and persistent stresses, placing transport corridors, energy transmission lines, heritage sites, and environmental systems at increasing risk.
