Vegetated Retention Structures: Creating barriers with vegetation to slow down water runoff and retain soil, reducing the risk of flash floods and erosion.

Slope Stabilization using Soil Bioengineering: Using live plant materials (like willow cuttings) to reinforce unstable slopes along the road and castle areas, preventing landslides.

Floodplain Restoration: Reconnecting the river with its natural floodplain to increase water storage capacity during heavy rains.

Hybrid Systems: Combining these natural measures with existing grey infrastructure (like culverts) to create a more resilient protection system against extreme weather events.
