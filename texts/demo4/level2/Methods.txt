The climate risk assessment applies an indicator-based methodology using regional climate datasets, including NCAR and IHCantabria data, historical records from the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute, and climate indicators developed within the project framework. These indicators describe both present climatic conditions and projected future developments of key climate drivers relevant to the reliability of transport, energy, and water management systems.

Climate hazards are classified into acute events and chronic processes, reflecting short-term extremes such as floods and windstorms, as well as long-term trends such as temperature increase, drought, and soil moisture decline. Hazard identification and characterization are performed automatically based on the geographic location and sector classification of each critical infrastructure asset. Climate drivers are linked to specific hazards, affected assets, and associated consequences, providing a consistent basis for subsequent risk assessment stages.

Hazard severity is derived from the percentage variation of climate indicators under mid-term and long-term projections for different climate scenarios. Exposure is calculated using user-provided economic valuation data, considering capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and revenues in relation to asset criticality and spatial vulnerability. Vulnerability is assessed by combining sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity captures the degree of damage, operational disruption, and maintenance implications caused by climate hazards, while adaptive capacity reflects asset age, maintenance level, and design characteristics that influence resilience and recovery potential.
