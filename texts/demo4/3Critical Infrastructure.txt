Zvolen hosts a variety of critical infrastructure that supports its role as a regional transport, economic, and administrative hub. These assets are vital for mobility, energy supply, water management, and public services, but many are exposed to the identified climate-related hazards.
Road and Rail Networks
The city is a major railway junction, connecting north–south and east–west corridors in Slovakia. Rail lines are electrified and serve both freight and passenger traffic, with Zvolen’s central station being a key operational hub. The road network includes sections of national highways and regional roads, along with local streets providing urban connectivity. Bridges over the Hron and Slatina rivers are critical for both transport continuity and emergency access during hazard events.
Energy Distribution Networks
Electricity distribution in Zvolen is managed through a regional grid supplied by both national transmission lines and local substations. The network includes overhead and underground cables, with substations located near urban and industrial areas. The district heating system supplies a large portion of residential and public buildings, sourced from combined heat and power plants. Energy infrastructure is vulnerable to windstorms (damaging overhead lines), flooding of substations, and wildfire proximity in rural-urban interface areas.
Water Management Structures
The Hron and Slatina rivers are regulated by embankments, small flood control structures, and drainage channels. These structures are designed to manage seasonal flows but have limited capacity against extreme precipitation and rapid snowmelt events. Urban drainage systems, particularly in older districts, are not dimensioned for high-intensity rainfall, leading to frequent surface water accumulation.
Other Public Infrastructure
Key facilities include hospitals, schools, emergency service stations, and municipal administration buildings. Telecommunications and ICT networks are well developed, with broadband coverage across urban and suburban areas. However, older buildings and infrastructure assets have not been comprehensively adapted to projected climate conditions.
