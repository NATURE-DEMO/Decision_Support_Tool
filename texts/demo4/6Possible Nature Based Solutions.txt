For landslide and slope stability risks, slope reforestation using deep-rooting native tree and shrub species can reinforce soil structure, reduce erosion, and stabilise slopes. In high-risk areas such as the selected NATURE-DEMO demonstration site, bioengineering techniques—such as vegetated geogrids, live fascines, and brush layering—can provide immediate mechanical support while vegetation establishes. These approaches can be combined with bioengineered drainage channels to control surface runoff and prevent water infiltration into unstable soil layers.

For flood mitigation, riparian buffer zones along the Hron and Slatina rivers can filter surface runoff, reduce bank erosion, and attenuate peak flows. These buffers, planted with a diverse mix of native grasses, shrubs, and trees, can be combined with floodplain reconnection measures to store excess water during high-flow events. In urban areas, rain gardens, bioswales, and constructed wetlands can intercept and infiltrate stormwater before it reaches the drainage system, thereby reducing pluvial flood risk.
Particular attention should be given to the Neresnica locality, located in the eastern part of Zvolen, where flood hazard mapping and historical records indicate recurrent inundation during intense rainfall and high river levels. This area’s combination of low-lying terrain, limited drainage capacity, and proximity to tributary inflows makes it highly suitable for targeted NbS interventions. Expanding riparian vegetation along the local stream network, re-establishing small retention basins in adjacent green spaces, and restoring overbank flow areas could significantly reduce flood impacts. These measures would not only mitigate flood risk but also enhance habitat connectivity and improve water quality in this part of the city.

For urban heat and air quality, urban green corridors linking parks, riverbanks, and neighbourhood green spaces can create cooling pathways, improve biodiversity connectivity, and enhance recreational value.Street tree planting with drought-tolerant native species, alongside the installation of green roofs and walls, can further reduce the urban heat island effect and improve resilience to heatwaves.

For wildfire risk, green firebreaks with low-flammability vegetation, selective thinning of dense forest stands, and agroforestry conversion of unmanaged grassland can reduce fuel loads and slow fire spread. In powerline corridors, these measures can be paired with regular vegetation clearance to reduce ignition risk while also providing erosion control benefits.

For windstorm mitigation, multi-row shelterbelts and windbreaks composed of native tree and shrub species can reduce wind speeds in exposed areas. In urban contexts, diversifying tree species and selecting wind-resistant canopy forms will reduce the risk of windthrow and associated damage to infrastructure.
