The town's climate is characterised by a mild humid climate with mild winters and an average annual temperature of 8.0 °C, in the growing season 15.0 °C. It is in an area of warm basin climate with frequent occurrence of inversions and low windiness.

Wind, prevailing wind direction: northerly 17%, westerly 15%, windless 25 to 480%,
Temperature extremes (heat, frosts): according to climate-geographical types of the territory belongs to the basin climate type (moderately dry to humid climate, large temperature inversion), warm subtype) January average temperature -3.9 °C and July average temperature 18.3 °C. The highest temperature measured was +37.8 °C and the lowest - 32 °C.
Storms and torrential rain: storms are most common during the summer, although they sometimes occur from early April to late September. However, the summer period (June-August) is the most favourable for storms. The average annual rainfall is 703 mm, but 850 -1,250 mm in the surrounding mountains. There are 2 rain gauge stations in the territory of the Zvolen district. Their location is as follows: 
●	professional meteorological station SLIAČ: 48°38´33´´, 19°08´31´´, 313 m a.s.l.
●	precipitation gauge station ZVOLEN: 48°34´15´´, 19°07´50´´, 286 m a.s.l.
●	precipitation gauge station ZVOLEN - Môťová: 48°33´54´´, 19°09´54´´, 300 m a.s.l.
Inversion: temperature inversions occur throughout the year, in the summer months they are night inversions from cold air flowing into the valleys, when minimum temperatures in the valleys are then considerably lower than on the slopes. In the cold half of the year, and especially in winter, all-day inversions are more frequently recorded. Unfavourable conditions for the dispersion of pollutants in the air occur especially during a longer duration of an inversion layer of greater thickness of approx. 400 - 500 m. Inversions are formed mainly in the autumn and winter seasons, and there are on average 110-120 days per year with inversions of greater vertical magnitude. These inversions are mostly disturbed during the morning. The inversion positions, especially in the town of Zvolen and in the river basins, create a considerable degree of chemical vulnerability to possible leakage of hazardous substances.
Fogs: they occur most frequently in the vicinity of the Slatina and Hron river basins with an average of 67 days per year, clear 48 and cloudy 119 days per year.
Snow calamities: occurring mainly in winter when there are significant snowfalls associated with wind. Roads are buried in snow and entire areas are cut off from supply, transportation, medical and other centres. Icing results in interruption of power grids and cave-ins on roads.
Frost and ice: formed in winter after rain or drizzle. A homogeneous, translucent ice shell is formed that coats objects and can cause tearing and damage to power lines, forest fires and other damage to property or even human health. They occur on some sections of state roads. I/50 and I/66.
